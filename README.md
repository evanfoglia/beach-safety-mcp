Get comprehensive beach and surf conditions for any beach in the world — just say the name. No API keys needed for most data.

> "How's the surf at Waikiki?" → instant full report

## What You Get

- 🌊 **Waves** — height, period, direction
- 🌫️ **Swell** — swell height, period, direction
- 💨 **Wind** — speed and direction
- 🌡️ **Temperature** — air and water
- ☀️ **UV Index** — sun protection guidance *(requires free OpenUV API key)*
- ⚠️ **Rip Current Risk** — Low / Moderate / High
- 🛡️ **Safety Score** — 1-10 with recommendations

## Data Sources (all free — no API keys)

| Source | Data |
|--------|------|
| OpenStreetMap / Photons | Beach name → coordinates |
| Open-Meteo Marine | Wave height, swell, ocean currents |
| Open-Meteo Weather | Air temp, wind, precipitation |
| NOAA NWS | Rip current risk, surf zone forecast |

**Optional:** Add a free OpenUV API key (openuv.io) for UV index — 50 requests/day free.

```bash
export OPENUV_API_KEY="your-free-key-from-openuv.io"
```

Set it once in your shell profile and UV data will be included automatically. Or pass it directly to the tool.

## Installation

### 1. Clone / copy the project

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd beach-safety-mcp
```

Or just copy the `src/server.py` file to wherever you want it.

### 2. Add to mcporter

```bash
mcporter config add beach-safety \
  --command python3 \
  --args "path/to/beach-safety-mcp/src/server.py" \
  --cwd "path/to/beach-safety-mcp/config"
```

### Set OpenUV API key (for UV index)

UV data requires a free API key from [openuv.io](https://openuv.io) (50 requests/day free):

```bash
export OPENUV_API_KEY="your-free-key"
```

Add this to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`) to have it available always.

### Add to mcporter manually

Or manually add to `~/.openclaw/workspace/config/mcporter.json`:

```json
{
  "beach-safety": {
    "command": "python3",
    "args": ["/full/path/to/beach-safety-mcp/src/server.py"]
  }
}
```

### 3. Test it

```bash
mcporter call beach-safety.get_beach_json beach_name="Waikiki"
```

## Usage

### From any AI assistant (via mcporter)

```
get_beach_report(beach_name="Waikiki")
get_beach_report(beach_name="Bondi Beach, Sydney")
get_beach_report(beach_name="Cocoa Beach, FL")
```

Just say the beach name — coordinates are auto-resolved.

### From the CLI

```bash
python3 beach_lookup.py "Waikiki"
python3 beach_lookup.py "Praia da Rocha, Portugal"
python3 beach_lookup.py "Bondi Beach, Sydney"
```

### Surf forecast only

```bash
mcporter call beach-safety.get_surf_forecast lat=21.27 lon=-157.82
```

## Notes

- Works for any beach worldwide — just name it
- NOAA surf zone data is most detailed for US coasts
- Open-Meteo marine data covers global oceans
- Some less-famous beaches may not resolve — try adding country/state (e.g., "Kuta Beach, Bali, Indonesia")
- Beach name → coordinates powered by OpenStreetMap + Photons (free)
